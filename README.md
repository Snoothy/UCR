Universal Control Remapper is a complete rewrite of the original [UCR](https://github.com/evilC/UCR), created in collaboration with [evilC](https://github.com/evilC/).

Universal Control Remapper is a Windows application which allows the end-user to remap any inputs from devices, such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, racing wheels, eye trackers, etc. to virtual output devices. Remapping is achieved by transforming inputs through plugins to a desired output device.
